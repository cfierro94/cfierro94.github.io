Hey there! I'm Constanza, I'm currently working as a Software Engineer in Google
Paris in the Youtube Classification team.

Here you can find posts that I do randomly to hopefully contribute to our
community.

I'm interested in grounding and reasoning NLP, in representation learning,
and I enjoy learning about cognitive sciences.

Here's my [resume](../assets/files/Resume_Constanza_Fierro.pdf) if you want to know more about me.
