Hey there! I'm Constanza, I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Google
Paris in the Youtube Classification team.

Here you can find posts that I do randomly to hopefully contribute to our
community.

I'm interested in conversational agents, so specifically in anything around NLU
(grounding and reasoning), knowledge retrieval, and generation. I also enjoy
learning about psychology and cognitive sciences.
