I"¼<p>Hey there! Iâ€™m Constanza, Iâ€™m currently working as a Software Engineer at Google
Paris in the Youtube Classification team.</p>

<p>Here you can find posts that I do randomly to hopefully contribute to our
community.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in conversational agents, so specifically in anything around NLU
(grounding and reasoning), knowledge retrieval, and generation. I also enjoy
learning about psychology and cognitive sciences.</p>
