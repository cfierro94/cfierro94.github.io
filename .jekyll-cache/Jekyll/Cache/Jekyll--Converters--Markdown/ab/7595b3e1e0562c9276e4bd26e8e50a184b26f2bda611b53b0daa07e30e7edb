I"t<p>Hey there! I’m Constanza 👋🏼 </p>

<p>Here you can find posts that I do randomly. Most of them (if not all) will be summaries of papers I read, these are labeled from 1-5 where (5) means I have barely skimmed it and (1) I feel confident that I understand almost everything about the paper.</p>

<p>I’m generally interested in conversational agents, so specifically in anything around NLU (grounding and reasoning), knowledge retrieval, and generation. I also enjoy learning about psychology and cognitive sciences.</p>
